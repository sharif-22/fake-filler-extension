# Fake Filler (Indian version)

This was forked from FakeFiller/fake-filler-extension, which was developed by Hussein Shabbir under the MIT license. The original FakeFiller is no longer actively maintained, so this version drops the free-version's restrictions on number of field inputs and ability to create profiles. It does not have the ability to sync settings across devices.

This extension allows you to fill all form inputs (textboxes, textareas, radio buttons, dropdowns, etc.) with indian dummy data. It is a must for developers and testers who work with forms as it avoids the need for manually entering values in fields.

## Forked from the following repos:

- `FakeFiller/fake-filler-extension`
- `calvinballing/fake-filler-extension`
